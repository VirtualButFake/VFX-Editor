# VFX Editor
A feature-packed editor aimed at ROBLOX VFX.
## Why this plugin?
* Sleek UI with a heavy focus on ease of use, written in Fusion
* All of your tools in 1 place. No more switching between several plugins.
* No learning curve. This plugin is similiar to existing ROBLOX features usage-wise, and you'll be able to understand all of it's features with no prior usage.
* Easily expandable - our code is open-source and we're always open to contribution.

## Features
* Modification of all properties - supports NumberSequence, ColorSequences, numbers and strings. 
* Handy graph editor for NumberSequences - supports bezier curves and all tweening variants while compressing the data when actually applying the property.
* Texture storage - no more "particle baseplates". We support both normal textures and flipbooks and will show them both in the plugin, allowing you to easily pick out the textures you wish to use without any unneccessary effort. The texture storage also supports categories, so you can easily access variants of a texture.
* Easily copy and paste properties. Unlike the original ROBLOX properties window, you can easily paste any property, including NumberSequences and ColorSequences onto other instances, with graph data transferring over.
* Organized interface - our interface takes heavy inspiration from the ROBLOX explorer and the After Effects properties panel, resulting in an easy-to-understand interface which just makes sense, even for new developers.
